# First-small-game-using-C
These are my first ever made terminal game using C language. After 1 year I'm uploading it in my github because why not to showcase it!

In the first game, the computer will choose a random number which you can't see. Then you have to choose a number from a given range of number. Everytime when you will fail to guess the number that the computer had choosen, your ateempt will increase untill you guess the correct number. You can play it with some of your friend to check who takes less attempt to win. The person who will take less attempt will win the game.

In the second game, the computer will choose rock, paper or scissor and then you have to choose rock, paper or scissor. Lets see who win!
